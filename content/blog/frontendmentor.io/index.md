This is a series of challenges from the frontend mentor website.

 Frontend mentor provides a series of jpgs of a design and the project involves mocking up the image in valid HTML/CSS. The goal is to recreate the mobile and desktop versions of the site as accurately as possible from the images. The desktop image for the site above can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LltWCnqginegxPwi0BO-hRTFqS0Z_MWy/view?usp=sharing). The mobile version is [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10MMZql2gszvv7cT8sT_ntmJisZJaM4JP/view?usp=sharing).

 I've also completed another, simpler [recipe](https://hilarious-yeot-9deb1f.netlify.app/) design. This is based on this [desktop storyboard](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1LzRLWmBCo57ehjpFZjor6kaIS7C8S6hl/view?usp=sharing). The mobile design for the site can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1S_2Twf0yxZF8XoDj9fL5WAwYcgxbSX2F/view?usp=sharing).
