Here are some useful repos of react app that use various automated tools to provide an automated report on how accessible the application is. The repo uses jsx-a11y that lints the code and highlights possible accessibility errors. I also wrote tests using Jest Axe, that tested the code for accessibility errors. Finally cypress lighthouse, to test the code when rendered in a browser. This can test for accessibility errors that are not visible in the code, ie. poor visual contrast between text and background.
