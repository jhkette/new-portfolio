Javascript array methods can be confusing. Often there are multiple different options you can use. I've made this simple guide using React and Redux that helps you decide which array method is best for you. 

Simply click what you would like to do and then add some further specifications and your array method is presented to you! Some example code is displayed alongside to help you understand how the method could be used.
