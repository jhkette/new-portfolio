This was a small experiment with the ml5.js library and React. The ml5.js library provides access to machine learning algorithms and models in the browser.

I’ve used React and ml5.js to classify images based on user input. The user simply needs to add an image to the dropbox. This user event then calls a function which classifies the image. I’ve used React Hooks in this project, this allows me to use state without writing classes.
