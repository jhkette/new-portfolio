This was a very small but fun project for my work at Birckbeck. The site is based on a [storyboard](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QfBa5iQgRmYQ_4sgaEC-uwKEoM156h3x/view) design that was given to us.

The project was to simply recreate the storyboard using HTML and CSS. The storyboard can be found here. I also wrote about how I marked up the project using appropriate semantic HTML. While the project itself is very stripped down, it was nevertheless a useful exercise in using a storyboard as a guide to mark up HTML and CSS
