My final project for my degree sought to combine my interest in data science with running/cycling. 

I gathered data using the Strava API (a social network that relates to endurance sports), then used various different sliding window algorithms to find a Strava user’s best performances from the Strava data. 

I then developed linear and polynomial regression models to predict an athlete’s future performances based on an athlete’s data’s relationship to broader datasets. The front end was developed using React and the server was developed using Node.js. I received a 1st for the project. At the moment it is a demo website. See https://github.com/jhkette/strava-app-final for the final code. 

*This app is only valid for certain Strava accounts at the moment as it a demonstration app - there are limits to how many users can access the Strava API*
