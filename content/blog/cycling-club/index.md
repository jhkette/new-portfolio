This is a WordPress site made for my locally cycling club as part of my BirkBeck degree. I made a WordPress theme as well as a google calender plugin and several Gutenberg block plugins. These are custom Gutenberg Blocks - that allow a logged in user to add custom design features via a CMS. These are created by installing the block editor library into a plugin file and then building the block. The library is based on an adaption of React.
