This is a WordPress site made for my locally cycling club as part of my BirkBeck degree. 

I made a WordPress theme to create a customised look and feel for the site. This was integrated into the CMS - to ensure that the user could edit as much of the site as possible. 

I also made a Google Calender plugin and several Gutenberg block plugins. The Google Calender plugin fetches data and displays events from a Google Calender. The Gutenberg Block plugins allow a logged in user to add custom design features via a CMS. These are created by installing the block editor library into a plugin file and then building the block by modifying an edit and save file. The library is based on an adaption of React - a JavaScript library. 

I initially created a HTML/CSS [demo](https://titan.dcs.bbk.ac.uk/~jkette01/wswstatic/) and used Vitest to test it. Finally, I used [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) to test the final website.
