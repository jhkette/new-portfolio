I often get frustrated when searching through documentation trying to find the best javascript array method to use. To help, I built this javascript array tool, which, given an input, provides a relevant javascript array method to the user.

The site is made in React and uses Redux to store global state. I also made a ‘Typewriter’ animated component, as I wasn’t satisfied with any react animation libraries I could find. The component takes some text as props then ‘types’ it out on screen. The component also has a delete animation, as though a user is pressing backspace, when the props change. This component is used to show some example code when the user has selected an array method.

This site was inspired by another site I saw which was made using Vue. I liked the idea and wanted see if I could make a comparable site using React.
